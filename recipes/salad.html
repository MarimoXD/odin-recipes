    <h1>Salad </h1>

    <p>This is my go-to unexpected side for Thanksgiving and other pot-lucks. Aside from being gorgeous, it holds up well when made ahead, tastes great at room temp, and appeals to lots of eaters because it's vegan, paleo, gluten-free, and low-carb friendly. The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
        <li>1 cup cinnamon-roasted almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut cores out of Brussels sprouts using a paring knife. Peel layers apart to separate individual leaves; place leaves in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk maple syrup, olive oil, Dijon mustard, and apple cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over Brussels sprout leaves; add cranberries and toss to coat. Add almonds and toss again before serving.</li>

    </ol>
